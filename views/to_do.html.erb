# to do
  # get some pictures for diamond products
  # make a table to link to for the Sales Flyer
  # get rid of the Tools table?
  # can I edit my table from rake console or make post to start editing tables 
    and have one page to make changes for everything
  # once Diamond Page is complete with formatting copy to other product pages
  # work on hardcoding index page
